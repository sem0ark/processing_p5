## Description
One of my school physics projects.
This program is implemented with Processing language and it can visualize magnetic field lines around different types of wires.

## Configuring
The simulation can be configured in the code setup funtion by creating some objects.

Types of wires:
- Circular
- Spiral
- Straight line
