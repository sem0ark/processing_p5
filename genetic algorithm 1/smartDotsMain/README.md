## Description
Implementation of genetic algorithms based on natural selection.

## Rules
All dots spawn with random set of genes (set of instructions where to go in current moment). Genes of dots that came nearer to the goal will be slightly modified and passed to the next generation. Upon achievement they will compete in speed of reaching the goal.

With this set of rules we can see that dots learn how to get to the goal by passing around obstacles.

## Implementation
Implemented on Processing language. Project was inspired on the Code Bullet video.
